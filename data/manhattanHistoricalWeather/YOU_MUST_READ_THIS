This data is historical hourly weather data from openweathermap.org

The data is for a point in the center of Manhattan

BE VERY CAUTIOUS: the times given in the raw data are UTC time,
and are NOT local time. So, if you are doing processing that
wants to correlate events that happened in local NYC time,
you MUST convert UTC time to local time. There are Python
modules that will do this. Trying to just subtract 5 hours
from UTC is not reliable, since depending on the date of the
year, NYC could be 4 hours before UTC or 5 hours before UTC.

UPDATE: You can now use the file called manhattanWeatherClean.gz
In that file, the data has been updated as follows:

- the date and time in field 1 are now NYC local time, and at the end
  of that field is a 3-letter indicator of what day of the week
  that data represents.
  
- the data was cleaned-up using the Python script cleanData.py

The weather station that collected this data is at the center
of Cantral Park in Manhattan.
