This data is historical hourly weather data from openweathermap.org

The data is for a point in the center of Manhattan

BE VERY CAUTIOUS: the times given in the data are UTC time,
and are NOT local time. So, if you are doing processing that
wants to correlate events that happened in local NYC time,
you MUST convert UTC time to local time. There are Python
modules that will do this. Trying to just subtract 5 hours
from UTC is not reliable, since depending on the date of the
year, NYC could be 4 hours before UTC or 5 hours before UTC.
